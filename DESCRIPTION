Description: With conditionR one can set so called condition contexts along the 
    function call stack and automatically have a condition object constructed 
    hereof when one wants to signal a condition. This allows for e.g. 
    hierarchical errors where a low-level error is embedded into a higher-level 
    context for better understandability of the error message and finer control 
    over the error class. Higher level parts of the condition message can 
    optionally be conditioned on the lower level type of the condition. 
    One can maintain condition contexts independently for errors, warnings, 
    messages and other conditions, and for each of these types optionally also 
    for an unlimited number of user-defined base classes.
